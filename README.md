# micropython_math_clock
This is just a small personal project using the knowledge that I have acquired from my electrical engineering course
I am making a clock using micropython and an esp32 for my roommate because he can't get out of bed. He's a math major and can do 3 digit multiplication in his head so I'm going to make him do 4 digit multiplication to snooze it.
